#### What i downloaded?
I downloaded the book Perl Basico Desde Cero (yes i'm Spanish),and i need first download some text editors like Sublime Text or Vim.
#### What i expected?
Learn about programming, that's a script language so i dont need much knowledge.

{% highlight perl %}
#!/usr/bin/perl
Print "Hello World!";
{% endhighlight %}
